# Credit Card Validator ðŸ’³âœ¨

Hey there! Welcome to my Credit Card Validator project. This little tool, written in C, uses the Luhn algorithm to check if a credit card number is valid and figure out which brand it belongs to. Feel free to use the project and suggest some changes and improvements! ðŸ˜Š

## Overview

This Credit Card Validator supports a variety of popular card brands, including:

- **AMEX** 
- **MasterCard** 
- **VISA**
- **Diners Club**

This project is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to extend, making it perfect for both learning and integrating into larger projects.
